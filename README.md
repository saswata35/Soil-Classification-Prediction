Introduction

The Soil Classification Prediction project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to understand and categorize different types of soil based on measurable environmental and agricultural factors. Soil plays a crucial role in farming, crop selection, and overall agricultural productivity. By analyzing variables such as temperature, humidity, moisture levels, soil type, and crop type, this project aims to build a predictive system that supports farmers and researchers in making informed decisions. The project begins with data collection and cleaning, followed by preprocessing and modeling to generate accurate soil classifications.

Middle: Role of the Project

The primary role of this project is to utilize machine learning—specifically K-Means clustering—to automatically group soil samples into meaningful categories. This classification helps identify soil behavior patterns and agricultural suitability. The model processes the given features, transforms categorical data using label encoding, and applies clustering to detect natural groupings within the soil dataset.
Through this approach, the project assists in:

Understanding soil characteristics

Selecting the right crops for each soil type

Improving resource management

Enhancing decision-making in agriculture

Supporting precision farming and soil health monitoring

By integrating data analytics and predictive modeling, the project acts as a tool for smarter, data-driven agricultural planning.
